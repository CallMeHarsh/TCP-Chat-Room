# TCP-Chat-Room
This application has one server that hosts the chat and multiple clients.
We are using the client-server architecture. This means that we will have multiple clients (the users) and one central server that hosts everything and provides the data for these clients.

## Usage
For the application to work properly we need to star the server first.

Then we can open multiple terminals and run clients.py file them these tereminals will be clients.
As soon as the client connencts it will be asked for a nickname and after client enters the nickname it will reflect in the server. Now multiple clients can type messages and our chat room is ready.
